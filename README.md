My Portfolio Style Guide

This is my style guide that is serving as a way for me to practice/learning coding (HTML, CSS) and also learn Github.
I haven't code in over a year. Something are coming to me and some other are really difficult to understand, specially new CSS like flex and grid.
It is a work in progress for me.

Here, I am adding the index file, which it is the Style Guide page, the sytles.css and all images necessary for the style page.
